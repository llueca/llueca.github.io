To demonstrate my skills as web developer, I should create my own webpage from the scratch. No Wordpress, no Drupal… just plain (now so) old PHP.</p>\n<p>Because, if I pretend to be a good web developer, I should be able to show it without sharing any code of projects where I’ve been. Something as ilegal as unprofessional.</p>\n<p>Ok. Today I’ve decided that maybe it should exists another way to show my skills with something less time consuming. Maybe I can recover my original idea somewhen in the future, but in the meanvwhile I would be able to show to the world what I can do.</p>\n<p>Today I create this blog to share my findings, my thoughts, my code… all about this profession that I really love. <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a> will help me by now.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy your stay in this site.</p>","fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"1 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"First post","date":"January 24, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/first-post/","previous":null,"next":null}}
